Brief documentation on how to use the CARE plugins.

= Details =

Use the following steps to build the CARE plugins to your workspace. 
  * Download the required plugin source code (currently move refactoring is supported)
  * Import the project into Eclipse workspace or checkout using SVN client from https://care.googlecode.com/svn/trunk. 
  * Create a new Eclipse Application configuration. Set the VM Arguments to -Xmx 1024m, -XX:PermSize=156m
  * The entry point to the refactoring process is *nz.ac.massey.cs.care.move.views.CareView* . In this class setup the absolute workspace path of the CARE plugin project. This is where all output files are written. 
  * Once you run the project as Eclipse Application, you should see the CARE menu in the target eclipse application. Click on the Move Refactoring and you'll be able to see a pane at the bottom. 
  * Now import a test project into the target eclipse workspace.
  * In the original workspace, under the CARE project, there is a folder called *projects-todo*. In that folder create an empty file with the same name as that of the project you are going to refactor. 
  * You can run the refactoring process using a + on the Move refactoring pane in the target eclipse workspace. Multiple projects can also be analyzed.
