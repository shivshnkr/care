= Installation =

To install the CARE plugin is through Eclipse IDE. For this purpose, we have created an update site "http://care.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/care-update-site/" to install the CARE plugin on any operating system. The plugin can be installed via Eclipse IDE using *Help -> Install New Software* option. Once the plugin is installed, it can be accessed through CARE menu (added to the Eclipse workbench) where we can select different refactoring options.
